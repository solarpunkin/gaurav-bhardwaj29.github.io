  <div class="til-body"><p>I wanted to create a subdomain <a href="http://emailer.gaurv.me">emailer.gaurv.me</a> for hosting an automated cold email drafting service as a Flask website on Google Cloud Protocol. I get that this is a pretty lame name - I am also not good with naming things. That being said, first I had to log into Cloudflare Dashboard and add a new DNS record with type: CNAME and name: emailer and select the proxy status as <strong>DNS only.</strong></p>
<p>I figured that the best way to enable HTTPS for Flask app is just to go with DNS (orange cloud OFF). Once the records are set, create a new project (recommended) on Google Cloud and choose an Email API - I am using <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com">Gmail API</a>. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID and add a redirect URI(s) which is your subdomain/callback URL - (<em>https://emailer.gaurv.me/oauth2callback</em> in this case). This creates a secret client JSON file which is visible for download only once.</p>

</p>

<p>Configure the scope of the API according to the project needs. Once the API service is set, open the left panel and choose Cloud Run → Services. This is where the website gets deployed. First of all, make sure you are under the same project in which the API is created. Deploy a container and create a service with a Docker image URL (dummify if not created yet). Choose any service name and select a region based on the needs of the app. My app was lightweight, so I went with two CPUs and 1 GiB. Allow authentication (<em>Require Authentication</em> for dev, <em>Allow unauthenticated</em> for prod) and add env variables as secrets under containers - this includes the client secret JSON file downloaded earlier, Flask app key and/or other secrets. The rest of the settings like scaling, ingress and instance/request-based are deployment specifics as they are app-dependent (Grok helped me through this). Finally, hit Create. </p>

</p>

<p>Now the service will be created (typically takes 10 - 15 seconds) with the service name. Select the service and it exposes a url - something like <em>https://service_name-xxxx.region.run.app</em></p>
<p>Then, I had to map my domain to my cloudflare account by verifying it on the <strong>domain mappings</strong> <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/run/domains">page</a>. I selected the service, added the subdomain name (e.g. emailer.gaurv.me), and updated the DNS records from cloudflare. I then waited for some time before the DNS was verified and https started working.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that domain mapping is a preview feature as of writing this, so it has some limitations. These limitations are that it’s <strong>available in specific regions</strong> (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/mapping-custom-domains#limitations">https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/mapping-custom-domains#limitations</a>). Since I wasn’t aware of this, I had to migrate my image to a new service in an acceptable region as a workaround.</p>
<p>Finally, the app went live, and I can now access it from my subdomain.</p>
