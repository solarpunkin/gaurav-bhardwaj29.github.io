    <h1>Gaurav</h1>
    <p>I like building things that work well and feel simple. Mostly with code, sometimes just an idea i'm curious enough to try. 
I am an engineer interested in all things tech and humans. This space is where i leave traces of what i've built and what i'm becoming. If you find something useful here, great. 
If not - i had fun anywayˆˆ</p>
